Number of nodes

X Y Profit(p_i) MinServiceTime(r_i) ProfitCollectingCoefficient(beta_i) MustVisit

Tmax

TIPS:
1. The first node is the starting and ending node.
2. ProfitCollectingCoefficient(beta_i) should divide by 200 when using.
3. Distance between any two nodes is Euclidean distance	and rounded to the closest integer.
4. The data generation scheme is from "Erdogan, G. , & Laporte, G. (2013). The orienteering problem with variable profits. Networks, 61 (2), 104-116".
